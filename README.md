# Network-Bandwidth-Monitor

# Overview:
The Network Bandwidth Monitor is a Python-based project designed to enable the identification of performance bottlenecks and potential security threats. By tracking resource expenditure and monitoring bandwidth consumption, it helps detect anomalies that could indicate the presence of malware or threat actors.

# Languages & Programs Used:
Python
Visual Studio Code
PSUtil & Time Libraries

# Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide users with a reliable tool to monitor their network bandwidth and resource utilization. By presenting the amount of data sent and received in MBs, it enables efficient monitoring of network activity, assisting in the identification of unusual or suspicious data transfer patterns.

# Key Features:
Accurate and consistent delivery of data usage in MBs
Monitoring of data sent and received, enabling efficient network activity tracking
Identification of unusual or suspicious data transfer patterns

# Skills Gained:
Proficiency in utilizing PSUtil and Time libraries for monitoring network bandwidth and resource utilization.
Understanding and application of resource monitoring techniques to identify performance bottlenecks and potential security threats.


# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script to start monitoring your network bandwidth and resource utilization.
Observe the real-time data on data sent, data received, and total network bandwidth usage.
